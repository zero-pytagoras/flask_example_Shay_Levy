# My Simple Flask Website 🌐

This is a basic web app built with **Flask**.  
I used a free HTML template and added a small Python function that shows the operating system the app is running on.

## 🔧 Features

- Clean and responsive template  
- Shows your operating system on the home page  
- Simple Flask routing (Home, About, Category, Work)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python and Flask installed
2. Run the app:

```bash
python app.py
